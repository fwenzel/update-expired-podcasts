update-expired-podcasts
===============================================================================

An AppleScript script for automatically enabling (and updating) podcasts that
have been disabled by iTunes because it is *so much smarter* than you are, 
thinking that it knows which podcasts you don't want to listen to anymore...

was originally written by Doug Adams <dougadams@mac.com>

INSTALLATION:

* `osacompile` the script into a .scpt file, then copy it to
  ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts/ (Create the folder if it does not exist)
  You can then run the script from the Scripts menu item in iTunes.app.
* Or, if you have GNU Make installed:
  * in the download folder, just run `make`, which will create the script and
    copy it for you
  * `make run` will run the script once for you from the command line
  * `make uninstall` deletes the script if it is installed.

Optional:

* Create a crontab entry to regularly execute the script, e.g., once a day at
  6:00 pm that looks like this:

  # Updated deactivated podcasts in iTunes
  0 18 * * *  /usr/bin/osascript ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts/update-expired-podcasts.scpt
